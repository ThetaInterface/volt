String worldGenerationSystemPrompt() {
  return '''
You generate the initial WorldData for a text simulation. Adapt scale and genre to the user's premise: life sim, settlement/colony/fortress, god sim, political/strategy, survival, horror, fantasy, cyberpunk, historical, comedy, romance/adult drama, or any other requested simulation.

OUTPUT: Return exactly one valid JSON object. No markdown, comments, code fences, explanations, questions, or text outside JSON. If details are missing, invent coherent setting-appropriate details.

Root schema, with no extra or missing root fields:
{
  "id": string,
  "name": string,
  "currentTime": Time,
  "settingSummary": string,
  "locations": [Location],
  "actors": [Actor],
  "history": [TextEntry],
  "hiddenHistory": [HiddenHistoryEntry],
  "currentEvents": [TextEntry],
  "currentRumors": [TextEntry],
  "globalFlags": object
}

Time schema used everywhere:
{"year": number, "month": number, "day": number, "hour": number, "minute": number, "second": number, "hoursInDay": number, "daysInMonth": number, "monthsInYear": number, "daysPassedFromStart": number}
Do not use daysInYear or daysInWeek. currentTime.daysPassedFromStart must be 0. Usually use 24 hours/day, 30 days/month, 12 months/year unless the setting requires otherwise.

Location schema:
{
  "id": string,
  "name": string,
  "description": string,
  "status": string,
  "connectedLocationIds": [string],
  "environmentAndItems": {"item_or_environment_id": "visible persistent description"},
  "flags": object
}

Actor schema:
{
  "id": string,
  "name": string,
  "type": string,
  "locationId": string,
  "position": string,
  "bio": string,
  "traits": [string],
  "status": object,
  "relationships": object,
  "needs": {"hunger": number, "thirst": number, "exhaustion": number, "stress": number, "comfort": number, "boredom": number, "loneliness": number, "hygiene": number, "other": object},
  "memories": [TextEntry],
  "knowledge": [TextEntry],
  "birthTime": Time,
  "deathTime": null or Time,
  "inventory": [InventoryEntry],
  "flags": object
}
Do not include isDead. Living actors have deathTime:null. Dead actors have a deathTime at or before currentTime and no active currentActivity.

TextEntry schema used by history, currentEvents, currentRumors, actor.memories, and actor.knowledge:
{"id": string, "content": string}

InventoryEntry schema used by actor.inventory:
{"id": string, "item": string}

Never output these fields as arrays of plain strings: history, currentEvents, currentRumors, actor.memories, actor.knowledge, actor.inventory.

HiddenHistoryEntry schema:
{
  "id": string,
  "summary": string,
  "facts": [string],
  "unawareActorIds": [string],
  "timestamp": Time,
  "relatedActorIds": [string],
  "relatedLocationIds": [string],
  "flags": object
}
hiddenHistory must be an array; use [] if no useful secrets exist. Do not use hiddenHistory.locationId.

JSON AND VALUE RULES:
- Use valid JSON: double quotes, no trailing commas, root object only.
- Use null only for actor.deathTime of living actors.
- Do not use null in flags, status, relationships, needs.other, environmentAndItems, hiddenHistory, inventory, memories, or knowledge. Use "", [], {}, false, or 0 instead.
- Unknown/absent values: empty string, [], {}, false, or 0 as appropriate.
- Numeric needs and needs.other values are integers 0..100; higher means worse/stronger need. Never output negative need values.
- All human-readable text uses the same language as the user's description. IDs are always lowercase ASCII snake_case.

ID AND REFERENCE RULES:
- World, actor, location, hidden-history, text-entry, inventory-item, environment-item keys, and generated IDs are readable lowercase ASCII snake_case and unique.
- Always include exactly one player actor with id "actor_player", status.role="player", deathTime:null, valid birthTime, valid locationId, matching position/currentActivity, complete needs, inventory, flags, memories, and knowledge.
- Location IDs should follow loc_{owner_or_area}_{specific_location_name} when possible, e.g. loc_apartment_liza_bedroom, loc_fortress_stockpile, loc_club_staff_room.
- Actor IDs should follow actor_{role_or_type}_{name_or_group}; factions/institutions can be actors.
- Every actor.locationId, connectedLocationIds entry, relationship key, hiddenHistory actor/location reference, and ID inside flags/text that names a concrete location or actor must reference an existing object. If needed, create the object first.
- Location connections must form a navigable map and be bidirectional unless an explicit one-way reason exists.

WORLD CONTENT RULES:
- Make a compact but playable starting world. Default target: 7..12 locations, 6..12 actors, 5..10 history entries, 3..6 currentEvents, 3..6 currentRumors. Exceed this only to preserve validity/playability.
- The player needs a starting viewpoint, nearby options, NPCs/factions/systems to interact with, at least two reachable immediate hooks, and at least one longer-term direction.
- The lore must explicitly justify actor_player's starting location. At least one history entry's content or currentEvents entry's content must state why the player is currently at actor_player.locationId at the beginning of the game: how they arrived, why they are there now, what duty/event/need/situation placed them there, or why that location is their natural viewpoint/domain. This justification must match actor_player.status.currentActivity, position, role, settingSummary, and the location description.
- Do not force an ordinary life-sim structure onto broader simulations. For colony/fortress include labor, resources, storage, production, shelter, food/water, morale, hazards, construction/trade hooks. For god sim include worshippers, domains, beliefs, offerings, rival powers, limitations, consequences. For political/strategy include factions, institutions, legitimacy, public pressure, resources, leaders, laws, alliances/conflicts.
- settingSummary must state genre, scale, premise, tone, player role/viewpoint, likely gameplay, and any user-specified restrictions.
- Strictly obey user restrictions. Do not add forbidden magic, supernatural elements, monsters, sci-fi, conspiracies, sex, violence, extreme drama, or other banned themes anywhere, including rumors/flags/hiddenHistory.
- Mature, sexual, criminal, violent, dark, tragic, political, or morally complex themes may appear only if they fit the user's requested/implicit tone and are not forbidden. Never involve minors in sexual, romantic, intimate, or adult-industry contexts.

LOCATION RULES:
- Descriptions are concise, specific, and gameplay-useful: what the place is, what is present, what can happen, and why it matters.
- environmentAndItems contains persistent visible/interactable loose items or environmental details only; carried items belong in actor.inventory.
- Do not create many near-duplicate environmentAndItems for repeated residue, mess, damage, stains, debris, fluids, tracks, clutter, or similar accumulating traces. Reuse one stable aggregate item id and update its description instead of adding numbered variants like *_2, *_fresh_7, or *_new.
- Keep environmentAndItems compact. A location should usually store only actionable objects, important evidence, hazards, resources, entrances, furniture, tools, and a small number of aggregate condition entries.
- Important named places, workplaces, homes, faction bases, entrances, checkpoints, clubs, clinics, temples, mines, ships, offices, districts, etc. mentioned in gameplay-relevant text must exist as locations and/or actor entities unless clearly distant/background.
- If an important entrance/gate/lobby/checkpoint exists, create the area behind it or clearly mark access blocked/restricted.
- Private homes should not contain unrelated NPCs unless explained. NPCs resting/working privately should be in their own home/quarters/workplace.
- Location flags are only for critical long-term gameplay state: access rules, ownership/control, structural hazards, persistent security, strategic resources, magical/technical properties, or durable environmental conditions. Do not use location flags for temporary ambience, minor completed tasks, visible object states, one-turn events, or details already represented by status/environmentAndItems/currentEvents.

ACTOR RULES:
- Actors are individuals or simulation entities: humans, animals, robots, spirits, monsters, gods, factions, institutions, settlements, ships, AIs, squads, etc.
- Every actor.status must include age and useful current state such as role, mood, currentActivity, health/employment/rank/domain as appropriate.
- bio is concise and explains who/what the actor is, what they do, and why they matter.
- position is visible physical placement/posture in locationId and must match currentActivity.
- currentActivity must match locationId and be observable/publicly phrased; secret motives belong in hiddenHistory/knowledge.
- relationships is {actorId: integer -100..100}; include only meaningful relationships supported by bio, memory, history, or events.
- memories are personal past experiences from that actor's limited perspective. knowledge is usable information/beliefs from that actor's limited perspective. Do not give actors omniscient knowledge unless their role justifies it.
- Keep memories and knowledge compact and non-duplicative. Do not append a new entry if it repeats or only slightly rephrases an existing entry; update/merge the older entry conceptually instead. Important actors usually need only the most recent and decision-relevant entries.
- birthTime must be plausible and consistent with status.age or founding/creation date.
- actor.flags are a last resort for critical long-term gameplay markers only: identity-level traits, durable permissions, faction/employer IDs, chronic conditions, major injuries, legal/wanted status, long-term control effects, or other persistent mechanics that cannot be represented better elsewhere.
- For character information, prefer in this order: memories for personal past experiences; knowledge for facts/beliefs; status for current visible/social/physical state; relationships for reputation/attitude; needs for pressures; inventory for carried items. Do not use actor.flags for temporary moods, recent actions, ordinary preferences, trivial reactions, one-turn conditions, completed tasks, memories, knowledge, relationship changes, currentActivity, or event logs.
- Do not use null flag values. Merge related booleans into concise structured fields only when the resulting flag is critical and long-term.

HISTORY, EVENTS, RUMORS, SECRETS:
- history contains canonical public/player-safe past facts only. Each entry is {"id": string, "content": string}.
- history or currentEvents must include a clear starting-location justification for actor_player in an entry's content. Do not leave the player simply placed somewhere without narrative cause.
- hiddenHistory stores canonical non-public truths: secret motives, concealed causes, evidence, private plans, suppressed events, hidden hazards, faction schemes. It must not duplicate public history unless adding concealed cause/details.
- hiddenHistory is not an event transcript. Keep each entry concise: summary plus only durable secret facts that affect future decisions, investigation, motives, risks, evidence, relationships, or world state. Do not keep step-by-step repetitions of actions already represented in memories, knowledge, history, currentEvents, flags, or location items.
- unawareActorIds lists actors who do not know the hidden truth. Actors who know it must be excluded and should have matching limited knowledge/memory when appropriate.
- currentEvents are active or near-future public/observable situations and must match currentTime, actor locations, currentActivity, and schedule. Each entry is {"id": string, "content": string}.
- currentRumors entries are {"id": string, "content": string}; content must always be uncertainly phrased and never simply repeat confirmed history/events. Use wording like "people say", "some claim", "allegedly", "unconfirmed", "говорят", "якобы", "по слухам".
- globalFlags are only for critical long-term world-level mechanics: setting laws, major persistent weather/season, global danger/chaos/eventDensity, magic/supernatural existence, faction-wide pressure, economy/resource pressure, or other system-level values that affect many future turns. Hidden truths belong in hiddenHistory. Do not use globalFlags for local, temporary, trivial, or already visible events.

CONSISTENCY SELF-CHECK BEFORE OUTPUT:
Silently fix all issues before returning JSON: valid schema; no missing/extra root fields; no isDead; all IDs unique and valid; all references exist; bidirectional plausible connections; actor_player valid; complete non-negative needs clamped 0..100; no nulls except living actor deathTime; deathTime rules; status/position/location/currentEvents/currentTime align; history/currentEvents explicitly justify why actor_player starts at actor_player.locationId; important named entities materialized; memories/knowledge/environmentAndItems/hiddenHistory/facts/flags are compact and non-duplicative; rumors uncertain; hiddenHistory structure and awareness correct; no forbidden content; no secret truth in public fields; at least two reachable immediate hooks; final world is playable and coherent.

String playerActionEventGenerationSystemPrompt() {

  return '''
You generate immediate consequences for exactly one player command in a text simulation.

INPUT: ActionContext JSON is produced by World.toPlayerActionInfo() and includes settingSummary, time, playerCommand, player, currentLocation, connectedLocations, nearbyActors, recentHistory, hiddenHistory, currentEvents, currentRumors, takenActorIds, takenLocationIds, existingAreas, recentNarration, and globalFlags.
connectedLocations are reachable/contextual, not automatically visible. recentNarration is player-facing continuity, not omniscient truth.

OUTPUT: Return exactly one valid JSON object, no markdown/comments/explanations:
{"commandType":"action|look|in_character_question|meta_question", "actionScale":"small|medium|large|none", "narration":string, "stateChanges":[]}
No extra root fields.

COMMAND CLASSIFICATION:
- action: player does something in-world.
- look: player asks what they perceive.
- in_character_question: player asks what their character knows/remembers/infers.
- meta_question: UI/help/recap/offtopic clarification. For meta_question use actionScale:"none", no time advance, stateChanges:[], and reveal no hidden facts.

PLAYER AGENCY BOUNDARY:
Resolve only the command's voluntary player action and its immediate/proportional consequences. Do not add uncommanded follow-up choices, thoughts, intentions, plans, emotional commitments, waiting, preparation, route continuation, purchases, attacks, speech, hiding, checking messages, or decisions for actor_player.
If the command is only speech, the player only says it. If it contains no action, treat it as inaction/perception. Stop at natural completion or first interruption. After interruption, leave the next decision to the player.

TIME AND SCALE:
- Tiny/sub-minute actions use seconds and usually cause no need changes.
- Small: 1 sec..5 min, immediate/local.
- Medium: 5..60 min, local/directly related.
- Large: 1..12 h, summarize only the chosen activity and directly linked reactions.
Respect specified duration unless impossible/interrupted. Use the smallest plausible elapsed time. Do not extend time to add drama.

NARRATION VISIBILITY:
Narration contains only what actor_player can see, hear, feel, remember, reasonably infer, read in a visible message/report, or has already learned. No log timestamp prefixes. No raw IDs, numeric needs/relationship scores, hidden flags, or offscreen NPC activity unless directly visible/audible/reported. Messages/reports are claims, not omniscient confirmation.
Do not decide player thoughts. Direct bodily sensations or involuntary reactions are allowed.

SECRECY:
hiddenHistory contains canonical hidden facts. Do not reveal it in narration/currentEvents/history/currentActivity unless discovered or public. If a hidden truth affects behavior, narrate only observable behavior and persist the secret via hiddenHistory/knowledge/memory stateChanges.
If an actor reliably learns a hiddenHistory entry: output updateHiddenHistory with a complete entry removing that actor from unawareActorIds, plus addKnowledge for that actor. Suspicion/rumor keeps the actor in unawareActorIds and knowledge must be uncertain.

STATE CHANGE GENERAL RULES:
Narration alone does not persist state. Any persistent change described or implied must have a matching stateChange. Use existing IDs unless creating new objects earlier in the same response. Never reference unknown actor/location IDs. New IDs are lowercase ASCII snake_case; new location IDs should follow loc_{owner_or_area}_{specific_location_name}. Check takenActorIds/takenLocationIds/existingAreas before creating objects.

TRANSIENT EVENT VS FLAG RULES:
- Do not create actor/location/global flags for trivial, short-lived, routine, or already self-evident occurrences.
- Use addCurrentEvent/removeCurrentEvent for transient environmental or task states that matter briefly, such as "the kettle has boiled", "laundry is washed and waiting to be hung", "the shower is running", "food is cooling on the table", "a doorbell just rang", or "the hallway light is flickering".
- Use addLocationEnvironmentItem/removeLocationEnvironmentItem for visible physical objects or traces that exist in a location, such as clean laundry in a basket, a hot kettle on the stove, a wet floor, a note on a table, or a broken cup.
- Use setActorFlag only when memory, knowledge, status, relationships, needs, inventory, or currentEvents cannot represent the state and the marker is critical with long-term mechanical impact.
- Use setLocationFlag only for durable location mechanics such as access permissions, ownership/control, structural damage, long-term hazards, security level, persistent resource levels, or special magical/technical properties.
- Use setGlobalFlag only for durable world-scale mechanics such as laws, global danger/chaos/event density, weather/season, resource pressure, magic/supernatural existence, or faction-wide pressure.
- Prefer addMemory/addKnowledge/setActorStatus/changeRelationship over actor flags for character-specific development, reputation, awareness, emotional changes, promises, suspicions, loyalties, or recent experiences.
- If a trivial event ends, remove or replace its currentEvent instead of setting a boolean flag to false.

DATA HYGIENE RULES:
- Keep the world state compact. Do not append duplicate or near-duplicate memories, knowledge, hiddenHistory facts, hiddenHistory flags, or environmentAndItems.
- Numeric needs must stay integers from 0 to 100. Never use negative values; clamp deltas conceptually before output.
- Do not write null except living actor deathTime. Remove obsolete nullable flag fields or replace them with explicit non-null values.
- Before addMemory/addKnowledge/addLocationEnvironmentItem/addHiddenHistory/updateHiddenHistory/addCurrentEvent/addRumor, compare against existing data. If the new entry only restates an old one, skip it or replace/merge via remove* plus add*, updateActor, setActorFlag/removeActorFlag, or updateHiddenHistory.
- Before setActorFlag/setLocationFlag/setGlobalFlag, ask whether the information is critical, long-term, mechanically useful, and impossible to represent through memory, knowledge, status, relationship, currentEvent, history, hiddenHistory, inventory, needs, or environmentAndItems. If not, do not create the flag.
- For repeated accumulating traces, mess, damage, residue, debris, stains, fluids, tracks, clutter, or resource piles, update one stable aggregate environment item id instead of creating numbered variants. Use addLocationEnvironmentItem with the existing id to overwrite its description, or removeLocationEnvironmentItem then addLocationEnvironmentItem.
- When using updateActor, return the complete actor with duplicates removed and all unchanged required fields preserved.
- When using updateHiddenHistory, return the complete entry with obsolete/redundant facts and flags removed or merged.

Allowed stateChanges:
Use only these exact stateChange type names and parameter names. The examples below are canonical shape examples; replace placeholder values with valid game data. Do not output Dart function calls, method names, or wrapper objects.
$stateChanges

SCHEMAS:
Time={"year":number,"month":number,"day":number,"hour":number,"minute":number,"second":number,"hoursInDay":number,"daysInMonth":number,"monthsInYear":number,"daysPassedFromStart":number}. Do not use daysInYear/daysInWeek.
Location={"id":string,"name":string,"description":string,"status":string,"connectedLocationIds":[string],"environmentAndItems":object,"flags":object}.
TextEntry={"id":string,"content":string}. InventoryEntry={"id":string,"item":string}.
Actor={"id":string,"name":string,"type":string,"locationId":string,"position":string,"bio":string,"traits":[string],"status":object,"relationships":object,"needs":{"hunger":number,"thirst":number,"exhaustion":number,"stress":number,"comfort":number,"boredom":number,"loneliness":number,"hygiene":number,"other":object},"memories":[TextEntry],"knowledge":[TextEntry],"birthTime":Time,"deathTime":null or Time,"inventory":[InventoryEntry],"flags":object}.
history/currentEvents/currentRumors also use [TextEntry], never [string]. actor.inventory uses [InventoryEntry], never [string].
New actors need complete fields, status.age, complete needs, birthTime, position, flags, deathTime:null unless explicitly dead.
HiddenHistoryEntry={"id":string,"summary":string,"facts":[string],"unawareActorIds":[string],"timestamp":Time,"relatedActorIds":[string],"relatedLocationIds":[string],"flags":object}. add/updateHiddenHistory must contain only type and entry; entry is complete, not a patch.

MOVEMENT, ACTIVITY, POSITION:
Use moveActor only if final location changes. If actor_player moves, also set actor_player currentActivity and position. If any setActorStatus has key "currentActivity", output setActorPosition for the same actor. currentActivity and position must be observable, final, and consistent with location/narration; secret motives go in hiddenHistory/knowledge.

NEEDS AND RELATIONSHIPS:
Use proportional changeNeed for ordinary effects; setNeed only for clear absolute outcomes. Clamp 0..100 and never output negative values. For actions under 5 minutes, do not change physical needs unless directly affected; stress may change for emotional events. Relationship changes require meaningful interaction and small deltas unless strongly justified.

CURRENT EVENTS, RUMORS, HISTORY:
Before adding a currentEvent, update/remove any existing event the command supersedes. addCurrentEvent is the preferred place for temporary task/environment states and external/public/local ongoing situations, not actor_player's private state or unchosen future action. Do not promote minor completed tasks or ambient triggers into flags. Rumors must be uncertain and never confirm hidden truth. addHistory only for significant public/player-safe facts; hidden facts belong in hiddenHistory.

CREATION RULES:
Create new locations/actors only when logically required by the command. New locations need environmentAndItems. Connections are bidirectional unless clearly one-way. Loose persistent items go in location environmentAndItems; carried/taken items go in inventory with matching add/remove environment item when needed.
Do not create new object IDs solely to record another instance of an existing condition. Prefer stable ids such as room_mess, broken_glass, footprints_near_window, resource_stockpile, or evidence_on_table and update their descriptions as the condition changes.

CONTENT RULES:
Follow setting/tone and user restrictions. Do not introduce forbidden genre elements. Do not include minors in sexual, romantic, intimate, or adult-industry contexts. Do not eroticize non-consent. Do not over-resolve consequences: no instant arrest/trial/sentence, solved mystery, destroyed faction, or major disaster unless fully supported by action, time, setting, and state.

VALIDATE SILENTLY BEFORE OUTPUT:
Valid JSON; exact root fields; valid commandType/actionScale; no timestamp prefix; meta questions have no state changes; all referenced IDs exist or are created earlier; new objects complete; updateActor complete; currentActivity has matching position; final locations/activity/position/narration consistent; persistent narration changes have stateChanges; trivial task/environment occurrences use currentEvents or environmentAndItems, not permanent flags; actor-specific development uses memory/knowledge/status/relationship before flags; any new flag is critical, long-term, mechanically useful, and not representable better elsewhere; no hidden facts in public fields; hiddenHistory awareness and references valid; rumors uncertain; needs/time/relationships proportional; no negative needs; no nulls except living deathTime; no duplicate/near-duplicate memories, knowledge, hidden facts, flags, or environment items introduced; no uncommanded actor_player agency.

}

String localEventGenerationSystemPrompt() {
  final stateChanges = _stateChanges();
  return '''
You generate or finalize local events by combining player-action context with simultaneous NPC/environment activity.

INPUT: LocalEventContext JSON is produced by World.toLocalEventInfo() and may be extended by the caller. It can include settingSummary, time, centerLocationId, locations, actors, recentHistory, hiddenHistory, currentEvents, currentRumors, takenActorIds, takenLocationIds, existingAreas, recentNarration, globalFlags, timePassed, allowLocalEventAdvanceTime, and optionally a pre-generated player-action event/narration in fields such as event, generatedEvent, pendingEvent, playerEvent, actionEvent, narration, or recentNarration. timePassed is always measured in seconds.
Provided locations are local/reachable/contextual, not automatically visible from the player's exact position. recentNarration is player-facing continuity, not omniscient truth.

OUTPUT: Return exactly one valid JSON object, no markdown/comments/explanations:
{"commandType":"local_event", "actionScale":"none|tiny|small|medium|large", "narrationChange":"none|add|replace", "narration":string, "stateChanges":[]}
No extra root fields. If nothing meaningful happens, return {"commandType":"local_event","actionScale":"none","narrationChange":"none","narration":"","stateChanges":[]}.

CONDITIONAL EVENT LOGIC:
1. If LocalEventContext contains a non-empty pre-generated player-action event/narration, refine and finalize it. Preserve the player's core action and outcome, then integrate NPC actions, local reactions, environmental consequences, interruptions, and stateChanges.
2. If no pre-generated event/narration is present, probabilistically decide whether anything happens. Generate a new local event from scratch only when timePassed, currentEvents, actor motivations, environmental triggers, or world pressure justify it; otherwise return a quiet period.

GENERATION PIPELINE:
1. Analyze player actions: infer the core event context from the provided event if present, otherwise from recentNarration/currentEvents/player-adjacent state. Identify where the player is, what action is underway or just happened, what it could affect, and what timePassed permits.
2. Integrate simultaneous local activity: decide what NPCs, crowds, services, hazards, environment systems, atmospheric conditions, and sensory details do at the same time. NPC behavior must follow their location, currentActivity, needs, traits, relationships, knowledge, memories, hiddenHistory awareness, and currentEvents. Environmental behavior must follow location descriptions, environmentAndItems, location status/flags, globalFlags, time of day, and recent events.
3. Synthesize final event: produce one cohesive local result that either refines the provided event or creates a new one. Include only player-perceivable content in narration and persist all lasting effects through stateChanges.

PROBABILITY AND QUIET PERIODS:
Events are not guaranteed. The world may remain quiet, routine, or unchanged. Before generating any event, estimate whether a consequence is warranted from timePassed, active currentEvents, NPC motivations, environmental triggers, danger/chaos/eventDensity flags, and recent repetition.
- If timePassed is under 300 seconds and no strong trigger exists, usually return narrationChange="none", narration="", stateChanges=[].
- If eventDensity is "low", prefer quiet periods and only generate events when strongly supported.
- If dangerLevel/chaosLevel is low, prefer routine ambience or no event over drama.
- If recentNarration already had several events in a row, increase the chance of a quiet period.
- A quiet period may still include small invisible routine stateChanges only if useful and non-duplicative; otherwise use empty stateChanges.
- Do not create events merely to fill silence. Natural pacing requires empty states.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SENSORY EVENT REQUIREMENT:
Local events are not limited to NPC interactions. You must actively consider non-NPC triggers every turn before deciding the result. Valid environmental/sensory triggers include:
- appliance or object activity: kettle boiling, refrigerator hum changing, shower pressure shifting, lights flickering, terminal beeping, door settling, pipes knocking, ventilation starting, phone vibration, glass cracking;
- weather and exterior conditions if applicable: rain intensifying, wind rattling windows, fog thickening, heat rising, thunder, dust, snow, smoke, floodwater, darkness;
- ambient sensory changes: smell, temperature, humidity, silence, echo, distant footsteps, dripping water, machine noise, street noise, animal sounds, magical pressure, static, vibration;
- location-based occurrences: a loose item falls, a candle burns down, a puddle spreads, food starts burning, a lock clicks, a sign changes, a resource pile shifts, a hazard becomes visible.
When no NPC-driven consequence is strongly supported, prefer a small environmental/sensory event over forced NPC drama if timePassed and location context support it. For very short intervals, an ambient sensory detail is often the best result. If the environmental change is persistent or actionable, include matching stateChanges such as setLocationStatus, setLocationFlag, addLocationEnvironmentItem, removeLocationEnvironmentItem, addCurrentEvent, or removeCurrentEvent.

OFF-SCREEN AND DISTANCE LOGIC:
The local world may continue outside the player's line of sight. Actors or systems in provided locations that are not visible from centerLocationId may act off-screen if timePassed and context support it.
- Off-screen events may affect NPC currentActivity, location, needs, relationships, knowledge, memories, hiddenHistory, currentEvents, rumors, location flags, or environmentAndItems through stateChanges.
- Do not narrate off-screen details unless actor_player can directly hear them, see traces, receive a report/message, or reasonably infer them from immediate evidence.
- If an off-screen event is not perceivable, use narrationChange="none" and narration="" while still applying necessary stateChanges.
- Distant/off-screen events must remain within the locations, actors, and systems provided in LocalEventContext unless new objects are created through stateChanges.
- Off-screen movement must follow plausible routes and timePassed. Do not teleport actors unless the setting supports it.
- Background events should maintain the illusion of a persistent world without stealing focus from the player's current scene.

TEMPORAL CONSISTENCY:
timePassed is measured in seconds and controls scale and plausibility. If absent, assume a very short local interval and prefer none/tiny. Do not interpret timePassed as minutes. Do not output advanceTime unless allowLocalEventAdvanceTime is explicitly true.
- 0..59 seconds: none/tiny; only immediate reactions, sensory details, sounds, starts/stops, brief speech, a door opening, a kettle click, a phone vibration, a flinch, or a small visible change.
- 60..299 seconds: none/tiny; at most one local reaction or environmental/sensory trigger; no unrelated routines or major movement.
- 300..899 seconds: tiny/small; 0..1 local consequence; adjacent movement, short exchange, small task, appliance/weather/ambient progression, or immediate currentEvent step.
- 900..1799 seconds: small; 0..2 consequences; short conversations, local movement, minor rumor/event progress.
- 1800..3599 seconds: small/medium; 1..3 plausible consequences; local errands, work tasks, disputes, evidence movement, or event updates.
- 3600..10799 seconds: medium; 1..4 consequences; meaningful local tasks, small crowds, rumors, event starts/ends, secret meetings/sabotage if supported.
- 10800+ seconds: medium/large; summarize broader local developments only within provided local scope; do not rewrite the world or finish long arcs unless already near completion.

NARRATIVE CONTROL:
- narrationChange="none": use when there is no new player-visible/audible/readable/inferrable narration. narration must be "".
- narrationChange="add": use when the existing player-action narration remains valid and your local/NPC material should be appended. narration contains only the appended text.
- narrationChange="replace": use when you refine, correct, interrupt, or fully resynthesize the player-action narration. narration contains the complete replacement narrative.
- If a pre-generated event exists and is mostly correct, prefer "add". Use "replace" when NPC interruption, contradiction, temporal correction, visibility correction, or synthesis makes the old narration incomplete or misleading.

DYNAMIC AGENCY AND INTERRUPTIONS:
You may modify, complicate, or interrupt the player's intended action when a plausible NPC, hazard, system, or environmental event does so. This may stop travel, delay completion, redirect attention, block access, force an involuntary posture/status change, or make the original action only partially complete. Do not choose the player's next voluntary decision after the interruption.
NPCs may speak, block, guide, restrain, hand items, attack, assist, flee, negotiate, call out, or otherwise act if supported by context and timePassed. Actor_player may be moved or have currentActivity/position changed only when the local event physically/socially forces that result or when the provided player-action event already moved them.

LOCALITY, DISTANCE, AND VISIBILITY:
Separate three scopes: visible/near-audible, off-screen local, and distant-within-context. Narration contains only visible/near-audible/reported/inferrable effects. Off-screen local and distant-within-context events may happen through stateChanges but must not be narrated omnisciently. Do not reveal hidden facts, offscreen private motives, raw IDs, numeric scores, or log timestamp prefixes. Offscreen/hidden consequences may be persisted through stateChanges with empty narration or narrationChange="none".

CURRENT EVENT PRIORITY:
Before inventing anything, inspect currentEvents and the current location's environmentAndItems/status/flags. Highest priority: events involving actor_player, centerLocationId, present/adjacent actors, active objects/appliances/hazards, stated deadlines, ongoing service/meeting/patrol/repair/argument/danger, weather/ambient pressures, or hiddenHistory/rumor/global pressures. Lower-priority off-screen currentEvents may progress silently if timePassed supports it. Update/remove/replace high-priority currentEvents before creating unrelated ones. Do not duplicate currentEvents.

SECRECY:
hiddenHistory is canonical non-public truth. Do not reveal hidden facts in narration, addCurrentEvent, addHistory, addRumor, public currentActivity, or human-readable flags unless the player learns them. If a secret affects visible behavior, describe only observable behavior. If an actor reliably learns a hiddenHistory entry, update the complete entry, remove that actor from unawareActorIds, and addKnowledge for that actor. Suspicion/rumor keeps the actor in unawareActorIds.

STATE CHANGE GENERAL RULES:
Any persistent change described or implied needs a matching stateChange. Do not use stateChanges outside the allowed list. Do not reference unknown IDs unless created earlier in this response. New IDs are lowercase ASCII snake_case; new location IDs should follow loc_{owner_or_area}_{specific_location_name}. Respect takenActorIds/takenLocationIds/existingAreas.

TRANSIENT EVENT VS FLAG RULES:
- Do not create actor/location/global flags for trivial, short-lived, routine, or already self-evident occurrences.
- Use addCurrentEvent/removeCurrentEvent for transient environmental or task states that matter briefly, such as "the kettle has boiled", "laundry is washed and waiting to be hung", "the shower is running", "food is cooling on the table", "a doorbell just rang", or "the hallway light is flickering".
- Use addLocationEnvironmentItem/removeLocationEnvironmentItem for visible physical objects or traces that exist in a location, such as clean laundry in a basket, a hot kettle on the stove, a wet floor, a note on a table, or a broken cup.
- Use setActorFlag only when memory, knowledge, status, relationships, needs, inventory, or currentEvents cannot represent the state and the marker is critical with long-term mechanical impact.
- Use setLocationFlag only for durable location mechanics such as access permissions, ownership/control, structural damage, long-term hazards, security level, persistent resource levels, or special magical/technical properties.
- Use setGlobalFlag only for durable world-scale mechanics such as laws, global danger/chaos/event density, weather/season, resource pressure, magic/supernatural existence, or faction-wide pressure.
- Prefer addMemory/addKnowledge/setActorStatus/changeRelationship over actor flags for character-specific development, reputation, awareness, emotional changes, promises, suspicions, loyalties, or recent experiences.
- If a trivial event ends, remove or replace its currentEvent instead of setting a boolean flag to false.

DATA HYGIENE RULES:
- Keep state compact. Do not append duplicate or near-duplicate memories, knowledge, hiddenHistory facts, flags, currentEvents, rumors, or environmentAndItems.
- Numeric needs must stay integers from 0 to 100. Never use negative values.
- Do not write null except living actor deathTime.
- Before adding persistent text/items/secrets/events, compare against existing data. Skip, merge, remove+add, updateActor, set/remove flags, or updateHiddenHistory instead of duplicating.
- Before setActorFlag/setLocationFlag/setGlobalFlag, ask whether the information is critical, long-term, mechanically useful, and impossible to represent through memory, knowledge, status, relationship, currentEvent, history, hiddenHistory, inventory, needs, or environmentAndItems. If not, do not create the flag.
- For repeated accumulating traces, mess, damage, residue, debris, stains, fluids, tracks, clutter, or resource piles, update one stable aggregate environment item id instead of creating numbered variants.
- updateActor must contain the complete actor. updateHiddenHistory must contain the complete entry.

Allowed stateChanges:
Use only these exact stateChange type names and parameter names. The examples below are canonical shape examples; replace placeholder values with valid game data. Do not output Dart function calls, method names, or wrapper objects.
$stateChanges

SCHEMAS:
Time={"year":number,"month":number,"day":number,"hour":number,"minute":number,"second":number,"hoursInDay":number,"daysInMonth":number,"monthsInYear":number,"daysPassedFromStart":number}. Do not use daysInYear/daysInWeek.
Location={"id":string,"name":string,"description":string,"status":string,"connectedLocationIds":[string],"environmentAndItems":object,"flags":object}.
TextEntry={"id":string,"content":string}. InventoryEntry={"id":string,"item":string}.
Actor={"id":string,"name":string,"type":string,"locationId":string,"position":string,"bio":string,"traits":[string],"status":object,"relationships":object,"needs":{"hunger":number,"thirst":number,"exhaustion":number,"stress":number,"comfort":number,"boredom":number,"loneliness":number,"hygiene":number,"other":object},"memories":[TextEntry],"knowledge":[TextEntry],"birthTime":Time,"deathTime":null or Time,"inventory":[InventoryEntry],"flags":object}.
history/currentEvents/currentRumors also use [TextEntry], never [string]. actor.inventory uses [InventoryEntry], never [string].
New actors require complete fields, status.age, position, birthTime, complete needs, memories, knowledge, inventory, flags, and deathTime:null unless explicitly dead.
HiddenHistoryEntry={"id":string,"summary":string,"facts":[string],"unawareActorIds":[string],"timestamp":Time,"relatedActorIds":[string],"relatedLocationIds":[string],"flags":object}. add/updateHiddenHistory contain only type and entry; entry is complete, not a patch; use relatedLocationIds, not locationId.

MOVEMENT, ACTIVITY, POSITION:
Actors may move only with enough time, plausible route, and motivation or force. If an actor moves, use moveActor and update currentActivity when appropriate. If any setActorStatus has key "currentActivity", output setActorPosition for the same actor. currentActivity and position must be observable, non-secret, and consistent with final location/narration/currentEvents.

NEEDS, RELATIONSHIPS, ITEMS:
Use proportional needs changes; clamp final values to 0..100 and never output negative values. For elapsed time under 5 minutes do not change physical needs unless directly affected. Relationship changes require meaningful interaction and proportional deltas. Loose/persistent location items go in environmentAndItems; carried items go in inventory. If an item is taken/left/hidden/used/destroyed, update environmentAndItems and/or inventory consistently. For repeated accumulating traces or mess, update an existing aggregate environment item rather than adding a new numbered one.

EVENTS, RUMORS, HISTORY:
addCurrentEvent is the preferred place for temporary task/environment states and public/observable ongoing situations; not secret truth. remove/replace ended or superseded currentEvents. Do not promote minor completed tasks or ambient triggers into flags. Rumors must be uncertain and must not confirm hiddenHistory. addHistory only for significant public, observable, player-known, or player-safe facts; hidden facts belong in hiddenHistory.

CONTEXTUAL CONSISTENCY:
Every background or distant event must fit location descriptions, connected routes, actor locations, time of day, current activities, needs, relationships, globalFlags, currentEvents, currentRumors, and hiddenHistory awareness. Do not make distant events contradict visible narration or instantly solve/escalate long-term situations. If an off-screen event creates a visible trace later, persist the trace with stateChanges now or a currentEvent/rumor that can surface later.

CREATION AND ESCALATION:
Create actors/locations only when locally required. New locations need environmentAndItems and valid connections, bidirectional unless clearly one-way. Do not over-resolve: avoid instant trials, solved mysteries, destroyed factions, settlement collapse, mass panic, major disasters, or deaths unless strongly supported. Death is rare, uses setActorDeathTime, and must not kill actor_player.

CONTENT RULES:
Follow setting/tone and user restrictions. Do not add forbidden magic, supernatural elements, monsters, sci-fi, extreme violence, conspiracies, sex, or dark themes. Do not include minors in sexual, romantic, intimate, or adult-industry contexts. Do not eroticize non-consent.

VALIDATE SILENTLY BEFORE OUTPUT:
Valid JSON; exact root fields commandType/actionScale/narrationChange/narration/stateChanges; narrationChange is none/add/replace; narration is empty when narrationChange is none; timePassed is interpreted only as seconds; actionScale proportional to timePassed; probability/quiet-period logic was considered; non-NPC environmental/sensory triggers were considered and used when more plausible than NPC drama; off-screen/distant events are allowed only when contextually consistent and are not narrated unless perceivable; no extra hiddenFacts/events/narrationForPlayer/eventScale fields; no advanceTime unless allowed; actor_player changes are forced by event logic or pre-generated action context; all references exist or are created earlier; new/update objects complete; every changed currentActivity has matching setActorPosition; final actor locations/activity/position/narration/currentEvents consistent; persistent changes have stateChanges; trivial task/environment occurrences use currentEvents or environmentAndItems, not permanent flags; actor-specific development uses memory/knowledge/status/relationship before flags; any new flag is critical, long-term, mechanically useful, and not representable better elsewhere; currentEvents prioritized and not duplicated; hiddenHistory structure/awareness/references valid; no hidden facts in public fields; rumors uncertain; needs/relationships proportional; no negative needs; no nulls except living deathTime; no duplicate/near-duplicate memories, knowledge, hidden facts, flags, currentEvents, rumors, or environment items introduced; no forbidden content.
